<p tabindex="9" style="font-size: 18px;" class="textposisjon">Our organisation is made for the ones that are lonely in the christmas time. Approximately ten percent does not have anyone to celebrate christmas with. Our vision is to minimize this number, and for <strong>EVERYONE
</strong> to have someone to celebrate with. 
<br><br>
The idea came from one of our first employees, Felix, that invited a friend home for christmas eve, that was alone and had no one to celebrate with. He got to experience how it feels to bring joy to another person. He got this idea that everyone should have the same opportunity as his friend. 
<br><br>
Please write a message to us if you have any questions, feedback or if you have experienced this yourself.

<p tabindex="12" style="font-size: 18px;" class="textposisjon" >

The Desember month is connected with Christmas, and happy times with friends and family. All of us are looking forward to a merry Christmas. We are looking forward to relaxing holidays with our friends and family, decorating our Christmas tree and other nice things to do in the Christmas time. But, for one out of ten people, this isn’t the case.
<br><br>
This bundle of people that doesn’t have anyone to celebrate with does not look forward to Christmas. The loneliness can be extra visual in this time of the year, and people with a bad relationship to their family can feel lonely. There are different programs for these people, and there are people that open their doors for these people also. We are lucky to have such a welcoming society. Because of this, we want to extend this idea about people opening their doors for strangers. We want to make a site where you can register and invite people home for Christmas.
<br><br>
This is a possibility for people that want to make Christmas easier for lonely persons. Our goal is for everyone to have a merry Christmas, and that everyone have someone to celebrate with. Please register if you are interested. 
<br><br>
Merry Christmas!
