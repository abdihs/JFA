	<h1 tabindex="7" style="text-align: center;">About us</h1>
	<p tabindex="8" class="textposisjon"><strong>Christmas</strong> For Everybody is an organization for those who are lonely through christmas. As much as ten percent of norwegians celebrate christmas alone, and we want to reduce this percentage. We in "Christmas For Everybody" got a vision that <strong>Everyone</strong> shall have someone to celebrate with. <br>
	<br>
	<strong>The idea</strong> emerged from one of our first employee, Felix. Felix celebrated christmas home in 2016, and he invited a friend who normally doesn't celebrate christmas to celebrate with him. Felix was surprised by the joy, happiness and gratitude his friend showed this night. Felix realised how little effort that was needed to make somebody less fortunate happy, and thought that this is something a lot of people can do. This inspired Felix to act on this idea and define our organization.<br>

	<h1 tabindex="9" id="ide" style="text-align: center;">Our idea</h1>
	<p tabindex="10" class="textposisjon"><strong>December</strong> is heavily assosiated with christmas and cozy nights. People look forward to gather their families and spend time with the people they love. Decorate the christmas tree, eat traditional food, relax and do several christmas family-traditions.<br><br>
	 <strong>But</strong> for one out of ten norwegians, this is not the case. ten percent of the population dread for christmas because they've got nobody to celebrate with. Many feel lonely and sad when they see people around them gathered with their families while they are for themselves. Persons with feudes with their families or persons who have no or few friends are often alone in christmas. The Church organizes events for thos who are alone, but these events cant be compared to a real family in-house celebration. <br><br>

	  <strong>We</strong> want to bring lonely people together, in their own homes, so they can experience an authentic christmas celebration. This is why we have developed our organization, where you can sign up to participate in other already signed up persons christmas celebrations. You can register that you want to welcome a certain number of people to your home, or you can sign up for an available spot in another persons home to celebrate. This system will bring people who are in the same situation together for a pleasant and refreshing holiday. We encourage you to apply if you are lonely or if you have the capacity to invite a few lonely persons to your home. Maybe you will make new friends? Our goal is for everyone to be excited for christmas and have someone to spend it with!<br><br>
